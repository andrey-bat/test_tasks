    "1. Using the dataset for Amazon Fine Food Reviews (https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews, Reviews.csv) create a simple recommendation engine which recommends products to users based on their previous experience and rates. You can use either a user-based approach either product-based one.\n",
    "To avoid excessive amount of workaround you can limit your model to score feature only (do not need to analyze review text).\n",
    "<br><b>Deliverables</b>:\n",
    "Your solution has to return three recommendations for every passed UserId and these recommended products have not match to products reviewed by user.\n",
    "2. For Text field in dataset please create a mechanism to determine a review’s sentiment. Try to suggest alternative approach to using score as a sentiment label.\n",
    "<br><br>NB: results have to be returned in .ipynb or .py format. "

The taffy was all very enjoyable with many flavors: watermelon, root beer, melon, peppermint, grape, etc. My only complaint is there was a bit too much red/black licorice-flavored pieces (just not my particular favorites). Between me, my kids, and my husband, this lasted only two weeks! I would recommend this brand of taffy -- it was a delightful treat.\n",

None of the candies were stuck together, which did happen in the expensive version, Fralinger's.  Would highly recommend this candy!  I served it at a beach-themed party and everyone loved it!\n",
